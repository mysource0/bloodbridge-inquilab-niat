ü©∏ BloodBridge AI
BloodBridge is an AI-powered, gamified platform designed to connect blood donors with patients in real-time via a conversational WhatsApp interface. Our mission is to eliminate the desperate, time-consuming search for blood, particularly for patients with chronic conditions like Thalassemia who require regular transfusions.

Project Status: This is a feature-complete MVP. All core logic for the chatbot, services, and admin dashboard described below is implemented and functional.

‚ú® Core Features
ü§ñ AI-Powered Chatbot: A WhatsApp bot, driven by Google Gemini, that handles user registration, emergency requests, and FAQs using natural language with conversation memory.

üåâ Blood Bridges: A flagship feature that creates dedicated, rotating groups of donors for patients with long-term, recurring transfusion needs.

üß† Predictive Donor Matching: A Python ML microservice that scores donors based on availability and reliability to find the best possible match for any request.

üèÜ Gamification & Engagement: A system that awards points and badges to encourage and retain a motivated community of donors.

üíª Admin Dashboard: A comprehensive web app built with React for admins to monitor all platform activity, manage users, and trigger actions in real-time.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The project is built on a microservices architecture:

[ React Admin Dashboard (Vite) ] <--- REST API ---> [ Node.js Backend (Express) ] <--> [ Supabase DB (Postgres) ]
                                                            |
                                                            +--- (Webhook) ---> [ WhatsApp API (Meta) ]
                                                            |
                                                            +--- (API Call) --> [ Python ML Service (FastAPI) ]
                                                            |
                                                            +--- (API Call) --> [ Google Gemini API ]
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Frontend: React (Vite), Material-UI (MUI)

ML Service: Python, FastAPI, Sentence Transformers, PyTorch

Database: PostgreSQL (managed by Supabase)

AI Orchestration: Google Gemini for function-calling and contextual understanding

Real-time: Supabase Realtime for live dashboard updates

üöÄ Getting Started
This guide will walk you through setting up the entire project locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js: v18 or later.

Python: v3.9 or later.

Git: Installed on your machine.

Supabase Account: To host the PostgreSQL database.

Meta for Developers Account: To create a WhatsApp Business App.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-folder>
Step 2: Set Up the Database (Supabase)
Go to Supabase and create a new project.

Navigate to Database > Connection Pooling. Copy the Connection string that starts with postgresql://. You will need this for your .env files.

Go to the SQL Editor, click "New query", and run the entire contents of the db.txt file from the project to create all the necessary tables and functions.

Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (.env files)
You need to create three separate .env files.

1. Backend (backend/.env):

Ini, TOML

# backend/.env
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET="generate-a-strong-random-secret-key"
DATABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_CONNECTION_POOLER_URI"
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
ML_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8000"

# Get these from your Meta for Developers App
WHATSAPP_TOKEN="YOUR_WHATSAPP_TEMPORARY_ACCESS_TOKEN"
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID="YOUR_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID"
WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET="YOUR_WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET"
WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN="create-a-custom-verify-token"

ADMIN_DEMO_PHONE="+91..."
2. ML Service (ml_services/.env):

Ini, TOML

# ml_services/.env
DATABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_CONNECTION_POOLER_URI"
3. Admin Dashboard (admin-dashboard/.env):
Get these values from your Supabase project's Settings > API section.

Ini, TOML

# admin-dashboard/.env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
Step 4: Install Dependencies
Open three separate terminals, one for each service.

Terminal 1 (Backend):

Bash

cd backend
npm install
Terminal 2 (ML Service):

Bash

cd ml_services
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Terminal 3 (Frontend):

Bash

cd admin-dashboard
npm install
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application
Keep all three terminals open and run the start command in each.

Terminal 1 (Backend):

Bash

cd backend
npm start
Expected output: ‚úÖ BloodBridge AI backend is running on port 3001

Terminal 2 (ML Service):

Bash

cd ml_services
# Make sure your virtual environment is active
uvicorn main:app --reload
Expected output: INFO: Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000

Terminal 3 (Admin Dashboard):

Bash

cd admin-dashboard
npm run dev
Expected output: A local server address, usually http://localhost:5173

üîë Accessing the Application
Open your browser and navigate to the address from Terminal 3 (e.g., http://localhost:5173).

Log in with the demo admin credentials:

Phone: The value of ADMIN_DEMO_PHONE from your backend/.env file.

Password: admin123
